# leaflet-challenge
Making visuals with leaflet!
A map was created using leaflet that displays data of all earthquake activity within the past 7 days. This map is interactive as you can click on each data point and get information on the location that the data was recorded as well as the magnitude and depth. The size of each marker corresponds with the magnitude level and the color corresponds with the depth (km).
